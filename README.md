# SpaceFight

Project in unity using ECS (Entity Component System). Following the course in that matter of Penny de Byl. You can find it in www.h3dlearn.com/courses or www.udemy.com

Since there is an issue with the ECS/jobs system and the webgl build system and it cannot be generated properly, a video showing it would do. The entities behave by themselves,  simply going back an forth between the planets and fire them when in range.
